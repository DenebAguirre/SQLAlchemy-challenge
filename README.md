# SQLAlchemy-challenge
In this project we handle two ways of working with data from a SQL data base. 
In the "climate_starter.ipynb" file I completed a **basic analysis** of data with some plots, just after **retrieving the data** from a sqlite file where I **built queries with Python SQLAlchemy**.
In the "app.py" I made a **Flask static server that is fed by the SQL** file and retrieves the requested data.
