# SQLAlchemy-challenge
In this project we handle two ways of working with data from a SQL data base. 
In the "climate_starter.ipynb" file I completed a basic plottign and analysis of data, just after retrieving the data from a sqlite file, building queries with Python SQLAlchemy.
In the "app.py" I made a Flask static served that is feeded by the SQL file and retrieves the requested data.
